# Kopdar Minimalist app build on top of Flutter E-Commerce App Template

This app (Kopdar) is build based on [Flutter e-commerce app template](https://github.com/abuanwar072/E-commerce-Complete-Flutter-UI) with several adjustment. Things added are:
1. Integration with [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) as state management
2. Real API call to [192.3.228.147](http://192.3.228.147:3000/index.html?urls.primaryName=swagger#/)

# TODO
1. Complete call API, ie: products, login, update profile
2. Build session management to employ cart
3. Payment integration, ie: xendit
4. Hotel integration, ie: MG
